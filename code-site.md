robots.txt与llms.txt优化


三个关键文件的作用
- robots.txt: 告诉搜索引擎和AI爬虫哪些内容可以访问
- llms.txt: 帮助AI系统理解你网站的结构和内容
- sitemap.xml文件如无则需新创建
具体操作步骤
1. 更新robots.txt文件
在网站根目录创建或更新robots.txt文件：
# robots.txt基础设置

# 常规搜索引擎规则
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/

# 网站地图
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml

# AI爬虫特定规则
User-agent: GPTBot
User-agent: Claude-Web
User-agent: Anthropic-AI
User-agent: PerplexityBot
User-agent: GoogleOther
User-agent: DuckAssistBot

# 引导AI爬虫到llms.txt
User-Agent: anthropic-ai
User-Agent: GPTBot
Allow: /llms.txt
Allow: /llms-full.txt
/这里添加你能知道的所有AI模型爬虫名称。/
# 允许AI爬虫访问
Allow: /blog/
Allow: /products/
Allow: /about/

# 不允许AI爬虫访问
Disallow: /user-content/
2. 创建llms.txt文件
在网站根目录创建llms.txt文件，结构如下：
# 你的网站名称

> 简短描述你的网站是做什么的，包括核心服务或产品。尽量在1-2句话内说清楚。

这里可以添加额外的背景信息，不使用标题。保持简短明了。

## 核心内容
- [产品](https://example.com/products)：产品列表简要描述
- [服务](https://example.com/services)：服务内容简要描述
- [博客](https://example.com/blog)：博客内容类型简要描述

## 常用资源
- [常见问题](https://example.com/faq)：解答客户常见问题
- [联系方式](https://example.com/contact)：联系我们的渠道

## 可选
- [关于我们](https://example.com/about)：公司简介
- [使用案例](https://example.com/cases)：客户成功案例
3. 创建llms-full.txt文件（可选但推荐）
创建一个更详细的版本，提供完整内容而不仅是链接。这个文件应该遵循相同的基本结构，但每个部分都有更多细节。
实施效果
经过这样的优化后，你可能会观察到：
1. AI系统更准确地表述你的网站内容
2. 在相关查询中，你的网站被AI提及的频率增加
3. AI能更全面地理解你网站不同部分之间的关系
实用技巧
- 简明扼要：使用简单语言描述你的网站
- 优先重要内容：突出用户最常搜索的内容
- 描述性链接：确保链接文字清晰说明目标内容
- 针对性定制：根据你的网站类型（电商、内容、服务等）调整llms.txt结构
- 定期更新：随着网站变化更新这些文件
这种双重优化策略所需的工作量很小，但能让你的网站同时适应传统搜索引擎和新兴AI系统，在未来的数字营销中占据优势地位。

The /llms.txt file
A proposal to standardise on using an /llms.txt file to provide information to help LLMs use a website at inference time.
Author
Jeremy Howard
Published
September 3, 2024
Background
Large language models increasingly rely on website information, but face a critical limitation: context windows are too small to handle most websites in their entirety. Converting complex HTML pages with navigation, ads, and JavaScript into LLM-friendly plain text is both difficult and imprecise.
While websites serve both human readers and LLMs, the latter benefit from more concise, expert-level information gathered in a single, accessible location. This is particularly important for use cases like development environments, where LLMs need quick access to programming documentation and APIs.
Proposal
llms.txt logo
We propose adding a /llms.txt markdown file to websites to provide LLM-friendly content. This file offers brief background information, guidance, and links to detailed markdown files.
llms.txt markdown is human and LLM readable, but is also in a precise format allowing fixed processing methods (i.e. classical programming techniques such as parsers and regex).
We furthermore propose that pages on websites that have information that might be useful for LLMs to read provide a clean markdown version of those pages at the same URL as the original page, but with .md appended. (URLs without file names should append index.html.md instead.)
The FastHTML project follows these two proposals for its documentation. For instance, here is the FastHTML docs llms.txt. And here is an example of a regular HTML docs page, along with exact same URL but with a .md extension.
This proposal does not include any particular recommendation for how to process the llms.txt file, since it will depend on the application. For example, the FastHTML project opted to automatically expand the llms.txt to two markdown files with the contents of the linked URLs, using an XML-based structure suitable for use in LLMs such as Claude. The two files are: llms-ctx.txt, which does not include the optional URLs, and llms-ctx-full.txt, which does include them. They are created using the llms_txt2ctx command line application, and the FastHTML documentation includes information for users about how to use them.
The versatility of llms.txt files means they can serve many purposes - from helping developers find their way around software documentation, to giving businesses a way to outline their structure, or even breaking down complex legislation for stakeholders. They’re just as useful for personal websites where they can help answer questions about someone’s CV, for e-commerce sites to explain products and policies, or for schools and universities to provide quick access to their course information and resources.
Note that all nbdev projects now create .md versions of all pages by default. All Answer.AI and fast.ai software projects using nbdev have had their docs regenerated with this feature. For an example, see the markdown version of fastcore’s docments module.
Format
At the moment the most widely and easily understood format for language models is Markdown. Simply showing where key Markdown files can be found is a great first step. Providing some basic structure helps a language model to find where the information it needs can come from.
The llms.txt file is unusual in that it uses Markdown to structure the information rather than a classic structured format such as XML. The reason for this is that we expect many of these files to be read by language models and agents. Having said that, the information in llms.txt follows a specific format and can be read using standard programmatic-based tools.
The llms.txt file spec is for files located in the root path /llms.txt of a website (or, optionally, in a subpath). A file following the spec contains the following sections as markdown, in the specific order:
An H1 with the name of the project or site. This is the only required section
A blockquote with a short summary of the project, containing key information necessary for understanding the rest of the file
Zero or more markdown sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, etc) of any type except headings, containing more detailed information about the project and how to interpret the provided files
Zero or more markdown sections delimited by H2 headers, containing “file lists” of URLs where further detail is available
Each “file list” is a markdown list, containing a required markdown hyperlink [name](url), then optionally a : and notes about the file.
Here is a mock example:
# Title> Optional description goes hereOptional details go here## Section name- [Link title](https://link_url): Optional link details## Optional- [Link title](https://link_url)
Note that the “Optional” section has a special meaning—if it’s included, the URLs provided there can be skipped if a shorter context is needed. Use it for secondary information which can often be skipped.
Existing standards
llms.txt is designed to coexist with current web standards. While sitemaps list all pages for search engines, llms.txt offers a curated overview for LLMs. It can complement robots.txt by providing context for allowed content. The file can also reference structured data markup used on the site, helping LLMs understand how to interpret this information in context.
The approach of standardising on a path for the file follows the approach of /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml. robots.txt and llms.txt have different purposes—robots.txt is generally used to let automated tools know what access to a site is considered acceptable, such as for search indexing bots. On the other hand, llms.txt information will often be used on demand when a user explicitly requests information about a topic, such as when including a coding library’s documentation in a project, or when asking a chat bot with search functionality for information. Our expectation is that llms.txt will mainly be useful for inference, i.e. at the time a user is seeking assistance, as opposed to for training. However, perhaps if llms.txt usage becomes widespread, future training runs could take advantage of the information in llms.txt files too.
sitemap.xml is a list of all the indexable human-readable information available on a site. This isn’t a substitute for llms.txt since it:
Often won’t have the LLM-readable versions of pages listed
Doesn’t include URLs to external sites, even though they might be helpful to understand the information
Will generally cover documents that in aggregate will be too large to fit in an LLM context window, and will include a lot of information that isn’t necessary to understand the site.
Example
Here’s an example of llms.txt, in this case a cut down version of the file used for the FastHTML project (see also the full version:
# FastHTML> FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore's `FT` "FastTags" into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications.Important notes:- Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services- FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte.## Docs- [FastHTML quick start](https://answerdotai.github.io/fasthtml/tutorials/quickstart_for_web_devs.html.md): A brief overview of many FastHTML features- [HTMX reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/reference.md): Brief description of all HTMX attributes, CSS classes, headers, events, extensions, js lib methods, and config options## Examples- [Todo list application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/adv_app.py): Detailed walk-thru of a complete CRUD app in FastHTML showing idiomatic use of FastHTML and HTMX patterns.## Optional- [Starlette full documentation](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/path/starlette-sml.md): A subset of the Starlette documentation useful for FastHTML development.
To create effective llms.txt files, consider these guidelines:
Use concise, clear language.
When linking to resources, include brief, informative descriptions.
Avoid ambiguous terms or unexplained jargon.
Run a tool that expands your llms.txt file into an LLM context file and test a number of language models to see if they can answer questions about your content.
Directories
Here are a few directories that list the llms.txt files available on the web:
llmstxt.site
directory.llmstxt.cloud
Integrations
Various tools and plugins are available to help integrate the llms.txt specification into your workflow:
llms_txt2ctx - CLI and Python module for parsing llms.txt files and generating LLM context
JavaScript Implementation - Sample JavaScript implementation
vite-plugin-llms - Vite plugin that serves markdown files alongside your routes following the llms.txt specification
Next steps
The llms.txt specification is open for community input. A GitHub repository hosts this informal overview, allowing for version control and public discussion. A community discord channel is available for sharing implementation experiences and discussing best practices.
